## The Big Mac Pot Pie: The Ultimate Meat Pie

Christmas is a time for tradition, and for many families, that means having a big, fancy meal on Christmas Day. But if you're looking to shake things up next year and try something a little different, why not try making a Big Mac pot pie?

This recipe takes all the classic flavors of a Big Mac and combines them with a creamy, savory filling and a flaky, buttery crust. It's the perfect blend of comfort food and fast food, and it's sure to be a hit with everyone at the dinner table.

Here's what you'll need to make this delicious pot pie:

<strong>For the sauce:</strong>

2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
3/4 cup mayonnaise

<strong>For the filling:</strong>

Pickles
Sesame seeds
Jalapeños
1 pound ground turkey
1 small carrot, diced
1 cup mushrooms, diced
1 small onion, diced

<strong>For the broth:</strong>
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup flour

<strong>For the crust:<strong>
2 premade pie crusts sprinkled with sesame seeds.

To start, make the sauce by mixing together all of the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.

Next, heat a large pan over medium heat and add the ground turkey. Cook the turkey until it's browned and crumbled. Add in the carrot, mushrooms, onion, and jalapeños and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender.

In a separate pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes thick and paste-like. Slowly pour in the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the mixture becomes smooth and thick.

Pour the broth mixture over the ground turkey and vegetable mixture, and stir to combine. Add in the sauce and mix until everything is well coated.

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Place one pie crust into the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish. Pour the filling mixture into the crust, making sure to evenly distribute it. Pour in the Big Mac Sauce on top of the filling and layer the pickles Place the other pie crust on top, and use a fork to crimp the edges together. Cut a few slits in the top of the crust to allow steam to escape.
