Measuring magnetic fields in their natural space environment, or "in situ," can be difficult because of interference from other artificial magnetic fields. These other magnetic fields, called "stray magnetic fields," are often created by the electrical subsystems on the spacecraft. The usual way to solve this problem is by making sure the spacecraft is very clean magnetically and by putting special sensors on a long arm that sticks out from the spacecraft. However, this solution can be difficult to use on small spacecraft, such as CubeSats, because it makes the spacecraft more expensive and harder to design. In this study, we propose an alternative solution by using a special sensor called Quad-Mag and a method to cancel out noise called Underdetermined Blind Source Separation (UBSS). This new solution allows accurate measurements without the need for a long arm and it works well even on CubeSats. The combination of Quad-Mag and UBSS technology has the potential to revolutionize CubeSat magnetometry, offering valuable opportunities for space research and exploration.
